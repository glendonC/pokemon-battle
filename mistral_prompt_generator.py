    Guidelines:
    1. The character should be a creature that evolved from or was inspired by the {object_name}
    2. Focus on these key aspects:
    - Main body shape derived from the object's form
    - Natural-looking appendages that make sense for the object
    - A signature element or type (like fire, water, electric, etc.) that matches the object's purpose
    - Special abilities that relate to how the object is normally used
    3. Specific requirements:
    - NO humanoid features (no human-like arms, legs, or face)
    - Must have a clear connection to the original object
    - Should include distinctive patterns or markings
    - Include at least one special ability
    
    Format the response as:
    The creature has [distinctive visual elements] and [special ability description].
    
    Keep the description vivid but concise.
